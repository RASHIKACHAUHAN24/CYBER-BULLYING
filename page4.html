        CAUSES  OF CYBER BULLING
        </div>
        <marquee>
            <b>CYBERBULLYING IS A CRIME!!</b>
        </marquee>
<P>Society has evolved in so many ways and yet stayed the same in many others.
Only the methods have changed.
Cyberbullying has been around for a while now, but people have just recently begun realizing that the problem needs to be addressed.</P>        
<p>There’s a common misconception that it’s only children that suffer from cyberbullying.
Of course, the issue does affect them.
It’s made worse by how hard it is for parents to keep up with what their children are doing online.
But cyberbullying is an issue that can affect anyone and does affect people of any age from all over the world.</p>
<p>The reasons why people decide to bully others online are varied, but this article aims to identify some of the most common factors.
It also gives advice for both parents and individuals on how to fight the epidemic and keep their children and themselves safe.</p>
<div class="body">           
<h2><b>THE MAIN OFFENDERS</b></h2>
<p>Technology is marvellous, but unfortunately, it also leaves some gaps where specific deviant behaviour worms its way through.<p>
<h4><b>How do cyberbullies target their victims?</b></h4>    
<p>A factor that exacerbates the problem is how easy it is to find and contact anyone through social media.
Young children have unprecedented access to a wealth of information and millions of people online.
This is dangerous, because, usually, children have to cope with bullying at school, but now it follows them home.
Plus, it’s not just other children that target them anymore.</p>
<p>The main offenders are social media pages, instant messaging and direct messaging apps, and forums.
Of course, these platforms almost always have rules of conduct in place, but they can’t monitor every conversation.
Privacy is also an issue, so usually, if someone doesn’t get reported, they get away with it.</p>
<p>The internet has given people unique access to each other’s lives and can take over if people let it.</p>
<h2><b>What motivates cyberbullies?</b></h2>
<h4><b>A lack of empathy</b></h4>
<p>Technology enables people to distance themselves from a situation even while they are in it.
Cyberbullies cannot see the pain they cause and thus cannot imagine the turmoil they put their victims through.
In fact, many cyberbullies who were ousted and questioned after the fact said that the act made them feel funny and powerful.</p>
<h4><b>Because they feel the victim deserves it</b></h4>
<P>When it comes to school children bullying others, it is often rooted in perceptions of status.
Insecurities are a major factor in bullying and pupils often try to put their peers down to feel superior.
<br>This is true for adults, too.
</P>
<p>It’s common for people to try and discredit or bully others based on a difference of opinion or a sense of superiority.
Celebrities aren’t immune to this either. </p>
<h4><b>Boredom becomes pain</b></h4>
<p>There’s no denying that cyberbullies get a sort of kick out of targeting others online.
After a while, it can almost become an addiction of sorts where they need a constant fix.</p>
<p>Anyone who’s ever been part of a Facebook or Twitter feud can attest to the fact that it’s too easy to get entangled.
These platforms make it hard to ignore incoming messages.
It’s easy to just type back a reply or keep logging on to re-read the messages.</p>
<h4><b>Self-loathing</b></h4>
<p>Studies have found that there is a strong connection between previous victims and current cyberbullies.
Much like violence in real life, virtual bullying is a perpetuating cycle of anger.
Therefore, the problem continues to cycle and gets worse each time.</p>
<p>These aren’t the only reasons cyberbullies do what they do.
But these are the more common reasons found among those who have investigated cases of cyberbullying.</p>
<P>Regardless of the reasons behind it, cyberbullying is a modern issue.
It’s a result of modern technology, and the problem can only escalate further as technology keeps getting more advanced.</P>
