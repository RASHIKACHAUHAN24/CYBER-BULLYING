       CYBERBULLYING'S IMAPACT ON SOCIETY
        </div>
        <marquee>
            <b>CYBERBULLING IS A CRIME!!</b>
        </marquee>
<P>More than half of children say that a cyberbully targeted them online. </P>        
<p>That disquieting stat comes from our recent global research on cyberbullying.
Overall, 57% of children said they were cyberbullied during the school year.
Meanwhile, many parents remain in the dark. Only 42% of parents worldwide said they were aware that their child was bullied online.
A distinct awareness gap. </p>
<p>And in the wake of those attacks, the risk of emotional and even physical harm follows. </p>
<p>That’s why talking about cyberbullying is so vital.
It acknowledges that cyberbullying remains a fact of life for children today.
Moreover, it gives families the tools to spot it—and help heal any harm that comes along with it. </p>
<p>Here, we’ll share some points that can help spark that conversation at home.
We’ll look at what cyberbullying is, its signs, its trends, and the steps you can take if someone you know is getting bullied online. </p>
<div class="body">           
<h2><b>What are the signs of cyberbullying? </b></h2>
<p>It’s no secret that children hide their online activities from their parents.
Our research puts a number to that.
More than half of children (59%) take some action to hide what they’re up to online.
As an adult, that means you might not see the offending text, post, or content yourself.
More likely, you will spot a change in behavior. <p> 
<p>Sadness and depression commonly appear in victims.
This can manifest itself in several ways, including the following signs as called out by WebMD: </p>
<ul>
    <li>The child becomes noticeably upset after being online or on their phone. </li>
    <li>The child doesn’t engage with family or friends. </li>
    <li>The child doesn’t want to participate in activities they typically enjoy. </li>  
    <li>Their school grades have unexpectedly declined.</li>
    <li>They don’t want to go to school or the playground. </li> 
    <li>Increasingly saying they’re too sick to do anything else. </li>
</ul>
<p>In all, spotting cyberbullying involves more than keeping an eye on a child’s phone.
Importantly, it calls for keeping an eye on the child. </p>
<h2><b>A quick look at cyberbullying stats </b></h2>
<P>With an understanding of what cyberbullying is, let’s look at what’s happening online.</P>
<p>Based on our research, children reported that name-calling, exclusion, and rumormongering were the top three forms of cyberbullying. </p>

<p>Also making troubling appearances in the list, by percentage:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Parents reporting racially motivated cyberbullying, 24%.</li>
    <li>Children reporting stalking, harassment, and physical threats online, 15%.</li>
    <li>Children reporting sexual harassment online, 13%.</li> 
</ul>    
<p>Also uncovered in our research, sometimes the cyberbully is our own child.
Among children worldwide, 19% admitted to cyberbullying another child.
However, follow-up questions revealed that 53% of children admitted to one or more acts that constitute cyberbullying.
Among the top responses: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Making a joke at someone else’s expense, 22%.</li>
    <li>Name calling, 18%.</li>
    <li>Excluding someone from a chat or conversation, 15%.</li> 
    <li>"Burned" or teased someone, 12%</li>
</ul> 
<p>With that, some children indeed cyberbully others yet remain unaware that they’re doing it.
Note that exclusion appears again as one of the top three offenders, such as where children shut out others in group texts and chats. </p>
<h2><b>The toll that cyberbullying takes </b></h2>
<p>Even in its mildest of forms, cyberbullying can lead to emotional harm.
Potentially to physical harm as well. </p>
<p>For one, a victim of cyberbullying will likely never view the internet the same way again. An attack on a person’s digital identity is an attack on their personal identity.
Both of those identities can suffer. </p>
<p>Children seem to agree. More than one in three (34%) said that they have deleted a social media account to avoid cyberbullying.
Nearly as many children hide the hurt.
Only 33% said that they sought help with cyberbullying. </p>
<p>This can impact mental health.
Faced with a constant barrage of insults and harassment, victims of cyberbullying often grapple with negative thoughts, insecurity, and even depression after their attacks occur.
In fact, according to research conducted at Penn State University, 30% of individuals who were cyberbullied turned toward self-harming behaviors and began having suicidal thoughts. </p>
<p>In response, 18% of parents said that they turned to therapy for support when their child was cyberbullied.
Another 11% said that they took the further step of changing their child’s school because of cyberbullying.
Indeed, cyberbullying can leave an indelible mark on the lives of victims and their families. </p>
