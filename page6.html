       A GLANCE OF CYBERBULLING IN TODAY'S WORLD
        </div>

            <b>CYBERBULLYING IS A CRIME!!</b>
        </marquee>
<P>While bullying existed long before the internet, the rise of smartphones and social media has brought a new and more public arena into play for this aggressive behavior. </P>        
<p>Nearly half of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 (46%) report ever experiencing at least one of six cyberbullying behaviors asked about in a Pew Research Center survey conducted April 14-May 4, 2022.</p>
<p>The most commonly reported behavior in this survey is name-calling, with 32% of teens saying they have been called an offensive name online or on their cellphone.
Smaller shares say they have had false rumors spread about them online (22%) or have been sent explicit images they didn’t ask for (17%).</p>

<p>Some 15% of teens say they have experienced someone other than a parent constantly asking them where they are, what they’re doing or who they’re with,
while 10% say they have been physically threatened and 7% of teens say they have had explicit images of them shared without their consent.</p>
<p>In total, 28% of teens have experienced multiple types of cyberbullying.</p>

<h3><b>Roughly three-quarters of teens or more think elected officials and social media sites aren’t adequately addressing online abuse</b></h3>
<p>In recent years, there have been several initiatives and programs aimed at curtailing bad behavior online,
but teens by and large view some of those behind these efforts – including social media companies and politicians – in a decidedly negative light.<p> 
<p>According to teens, parents are doing the best of the five groups asked about in terms of addressing online harassment and online bullying,
with 66% of teens saying parents are doing at least a good job, including one-in-five saying it is an excellent job.
Roughly four-in-ten teens report thinking teachers (40%) or law enforcement (37%) are doing a good or excellent job addressing online abuse.
A quarter of teens say social media sites are doing at least a good job addressing online harassment and cyberbullying, and just 18% say the same of elected officials.
In fact, 44% of teens say elected officials have done a poor job addressing online harassment and online bullying.</p>

<h3><b>Teens who have been cyberbullied are more critical of how various groups have addressed online bullying than those who haven’t</b></h3>
<P>Teens who have experienced harassment or bullying online have a very different perspective on how various groups have been handling cyberbullying compared with those who have not faced this type of abuse.
Some 53% of teens who have been cyberbullied say elected officials have done a poor job when it comes to addressing online harassment and online bullying, while 38% who have not undergone these experiences say the same (a 15 percentage point gap).
Double-digit differences also appear between teens who have and have not been cyberbullied in their views on how law enforcement, social media sites and teachers have addressed online abuse,
with teens who have been harassed or bullied online being more critical of each of these three groups.
These harassed teens are also twice as likely as their peers who report no abuse to say parents have done a poor job of combatting online harassment and bullying.</P>
<p>Aside from these differences based on personal experience with cyberbullying, only a few differences are seen across major demographic groups.
For example, Black teens express greater cynicism than White teens about how law enforcement has fared in this space: 33% of Black teens say law enforcement is doing a poor job when it comes to addressing online harassment and online bullying; 21% of White teens say the same.
Hispanic teens (25%) do not differ from either group on this question. </p>

<h3><b>Large majorities of teens believe permanent bans from social media and criminal charges can help reduce harassment on the platforms</b></h3>
<p>Teens have varying views about possible actions that could help to curb the amount of online harassment youth encounter on social media.</p>
<p>While a majority of teens say each of five possible solutions asked about in the survey would at least help a little, certain measures are viewed as being more effective than others.</p>
<p>Teens see the most benefit in criminal charges for users who bully or harass on social media or permanently locking these users out of their account.
Half of teens say each of these options would help a lot in reducing the amount of harassment and bullying teens may face on social media sites.</p>

    <img src="images/p461.webp" height="370px" width="570px">

<p>About four-in-ten teens think that if social media companies looked for and deleted posts they think are bullying or harassing (42%) or if users of these platforms were required to use their real names and pictures (37%) it would help a lot in addressing these issues.
The idea of forcing people to use their real name while online has long existed and been heavily debated: Proponents see it as a way to hold bad actors accountable and keep online conversations more civil,
while detractors believe it would do little to solve harassment and could even worsen it.</p>
<p>Three-in-ten teens say school districts monitoring students’ social media activity for bullying or harassment would help a lot. Some school districts already use digital monitoring software to help them identify worrying student behavior on school-owned devices,
social media and other online platforms.
However, these programs have been met with criticism regarding privacy issues, mixed results and whether they do more harm than good.</p>
<p>Having personally experienced online harassment is unrelated to a teen’s view on whether these potential measures would help a lot in reducing these types of adverse experiences on social media. Views do vary widely by a teen’s racial or ethnic background, however.</p>

<p>Black or Hispanic teens are consistently more optimistic than White teens about the effectiveness of each of these measures.</p>
<p>Majorities of both Black and Hispanic teens say permanently locking users out of their account if they bully or harass others or criminal charges for users who bully or harass on social media would help a lot, while about four-in-ten White teens express each view.</p>
<p>In the case of permanent bans, Black teens further stand out from their Hispanic peers: Seven-in-ten say this would help a lot, followed by 59% of Hispanic teens and 42% of White teens.</p>
